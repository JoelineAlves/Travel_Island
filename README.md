# Travel Island

![Travel Island  mockup images](assets/readme_files/mockup.jpg)

Travel Island is an online platform that aims to make known the services and tourist activities that visitors and lovers of the islands of Cape Verde will have the opportunity to do
during their travels.

The platform highlights the various areas of activity and service, from the typical foods of the islands, water activities, island tours, the best places to see the sunrise and sunset, the festive seasons during the year, the points considered most incredible of the islands and among others.

Platform's objective is to give greater visibility to Cape Verde, both internationally and nationally, bringing people closer to knowing more about the culture and the paradise that is the country and facilitating access to different services and activities. And, with that, boost the country's domestic tourism.

![Color scheme image](assets/readme-files/color-scheme.png)

The colors used on the website are white in different tones used for focusing effects, in some paragraphs and also as background-color (#fafafa, #f9f9f9, #fff), an orange color also in different tones in rgba format for the titles in the navbar, icons, paragraphs in the footer and in the contact form and also as background-color (rgba(255, 166, 0, 0.959), rgba(247, 185, 72, 0.959)), gray as background navbar and footer, also used in the form (#333, rgb(112, 110, 110)), the color black is used in some headins and paragraphs. These colors are chosen to attract more attention from the website user and also to favor the Travel Island logo, and also for good readability and user perception.

### Typography

The main font used on the site is Roboto, with Sans Serif as a fallback font if Roboto is not importing correctly. I decided to use just one font.

### Wireframes
